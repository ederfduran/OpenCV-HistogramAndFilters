**TOOL SET:**

* macOS Mojave
* CMake and Make (Build Project)

There are some important things to notice here:

* /vscode is a folder generated by vsCode to set up the debug functionality.Also has a c_cpp_properties.json to help the intellÂ¡sense to find the headers. Make sure you set up these files according with your directories. (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/c-cpp-properties-schema-reference)
